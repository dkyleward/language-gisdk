# GISDK Syntax Highlighting

Provides basic syntax highlighting for GISDK code (`.rsc`) objects. To install, clone or
download the package and from the top-level package folder, run

    apm install .
    
As the syntax for GISDK is heavily influenced by C, much of the package code is ported
from [language-c](https://github.com/atom/language-c).

Contributions are welcome.
